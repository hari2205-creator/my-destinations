            <p>The construction of the fort dates back to the 12th century when the city of Kurnool was used as a base on Tungabhadra river crossing. Kurnool was occupied by Vijayanagara ruler Devaraya II and Achyutaraya who succeeded Krishnadevaraya built the initial fort between 1530 and 1542.

                The fort has different gateways and bastions. The gateways of the fort were constructed by Gopala Raja, the grandson of Rama Raja of Talikota Vijayanagara kings in the 17th century.
                
                The fort is named after Konda Reddy, the last ruler of Alampur who was imprisoned in the fort by the Kurnool Nawab in the 17th century. Locals and legend state that Konda Reddy was under attack, and used the tunnels that the fort housed to escape. Konda Reddy eventually escaped from the fort, but had to lose his territory to Golconda Nawabs. The tunnels are now locked and closed off from the public, but the fort is open to touring. The citadel has been restored in recent years and is quite Popular with couples and the younger residents of the city.[3]</p>

                <p>The river Tungabhadra derives its name from two streams, viz., the Tunga, about 147 km (91 mi) long, and the Bhadra, about 178 km (111 mi) long, which rise in the Western Ghats. The river after the confluence of the two streams near Shimoga runs for about 531 km (330 mi) till it joins the river Krishna at Sangamaleshwaram in Andhra Pradesh. It runs for 382 km (237 mi) in Karnataka, forms the boundary between Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh for 58 km (36 mi) and further runs for the next 91 km (57 mi) in Andhra Pradesh. The total catchment area of the river is 69,552 km2 (26,854 sq mi) up to its confluence with Krishna and it is 28,177 km2 (10,879 sq mi) up to Tungabhadra Dam. It is influenced chiefly by the South-West monsoon. It is a perennial river, but the summer flows dwindle to as low as 2.83 to 1.42 cumec</p>
